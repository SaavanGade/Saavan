This code is a simple task management program that allows the user to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and list all the tasks. . The program begins by defining an empty dictionary called tasks. The dictionary will store the tasks as keys and a boolean value indicating whether the task has been completed or not. . The program then defines three functions: . add_task: This function adds a task to the dictionary with a value of False (indicating it has not been completed yet). complete_task: This function sets the value of a given task to True (indicating it has been completed). list_tasks: This function iterates through the tasks in the dictionary and prints the task name and its completion status. The program then enters a while loop that prompts the user for an action (either &quot;add&quot;, &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, or &quot;quit&quot;). If the action is &quot;add&quot;, the program prompts the user for a task and adds it to the dictionary using the add_task function. If the action is &quot;complete&quot;, the program prompts the user for a task and marks it as complete using the complete_task function. If the action is &quot;list&quot;, the program lists all the tasks using the list_tasks function. If the action is &quot;quit&quot;, the program breaks out of the while loop and ends. If the user enters an invalid action, the program prints an error message. . Finally, after the while loop ends, the program prints the dictionary of tasks. .

You chose paper and the computer chose rock You win! . This code is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows the user to play against the computer. . The program begins by importing the random module and defining a list of choices. It then defines the play_game function, which prompts the user for their choice and generates a random choice for the computer using the random.choice function. . The program then determines the winner of the game by comparing the user&#39;s choice and the computer&#39;s choice. If the user&#39;s choice is the same as the computer&#39;s choice, it&#39;s a tie. Otherwise, it checks if the user&#39;s choice wins against the computer&#39;s choice using a series of if statements. If none of the conditions are met, the result is &quot;Computer wins&quot;. . The program then prints the results of the game, including the user&#39;s choice and the computer&#39;s choice. . To play the game, you can run this code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it with python filename.py. The program will prompt you to enter your choice, and then print the results of the game. . This is a simple mad libs game . def mad_libs(): noun = input(&quot;Enter a noun: &quot;) verb = input(&quot;Enter a verb: &quot;) adjective = input(&quot;Enter an adjective: &quot;) adverb = input(&quot;Enter an adverb: &quot;) print(f&quot;The {adjective} {noun} likes to {verb} {adverb}.&quot;) mad_libs() . The fast saavan likes to run a lot. . This code is a simple Mad Libs program that prompts the user for a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb, and then uses those words to create and print a sentence. . The program begins by defining the mad_libs function, which prompts the user for a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb and stores them in variables. It then uses these variables to create a sentence using string formatting, and prints the sentence to the screen. . To play Mad Libs, you can run this code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it with python filename.py. The program will prompt you to enter the words, and then print the generated sentence. You can customize the program by adding more prompts for different parts of speech and incorporating them into the sentence. You can also add more sentences or create a function to generate multiple Mad Libs sentences. Let me know if you have any specific questions about how to customize the program! .",

As a student taking an AP Computer Science quiz, I have experienced common technical mistakes such as forgetting to include necessary syntax in my code. This can include missing semicolons, parentheses, or brackets, which can cause the code to fail to compile. I have also made mistakes such as using incorrect variable types or not declaring variables correctly, which can cause unexpected errors when running the program. . In addition to technical mistakes, I have also made logical errors in my code. This can include using the wrong operator or conditional statement, which can result in incorrect output or unexpected behavior. To avoid these types of mistakes, I have learned to carefully review my code and understand the logic behind it. . Fortunately, there are several helpful tools available for identifying and correcting technical mistakes in code. Debugging tools, such as breakpoints and variable watches, can be found in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and can help students to identify and fix technical mistakes in their code. By utilizing these tools and taking a careful approach to coding, I can continue to improve my programming skills and avoid technical mistakes in the future. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space and time complexity beacuse of these following reasons. . Efficiency:Space and time complexity help analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. An efficient algorithm can save computational resources, reducing the time and memory required to process data. This is particularly important when working with large datasets or complex operations. An algorithm with lower space and time complexity is more likely to scale well with increasing data size or complexity.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think that this code primarily deals with both time and space complexity and this is because . The code involves various operations such as opening and resizing images, saving them to buffers, and encoding them in base64 format. These operations contribute to the time complexity of the code. Additionally, the loop that iterates through the list of images (in the main block) adds to the time complexity since the number of iterations will depend on the number of images in the list. . | It also deals ith Space complexity because the code stores multiple copies of the image (original and scaled) and their metadata in dictionaries, which contribute to the space complexity. The size of these data structures will depend on the number of images being processed and the size of the images themselves. Moreover, the BytesIO buffer used to save the image temporarily also contributes to the space complexity. . | . Big O Notation .

When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0

Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Hacks Answers . Time complexity is an important concept when discussing sorting algorithms, as it helps us to understand the efficiency of different algorithms. Here are some common sorting algorithms and their time complexity: Bubble Sort: O(n^2) average and worst-case, O(n) best-case | Selection Sort: O(n^2) average and worst-case, O(n^2) best-case | . | Insertion Sort: O(n^2) average and worst-case, O(n) best-case | . | Merge Sort: O(n*log(n)) average, worst-case, and best-case | . | Quick Sort: O(n*log(n)) average and best-case, O(n^2) worst-case | . | Heap Sort: O(nlog(n)) average and worst-case, O(nlog(n)) best-case | . | . Time and space complexity are crucial when choosing an algorithm because they give us an estimate of the resources required to perform a task. Time complexity relates to the number of operations an algorithm takes to complete, while space complexity concerns the amount of memory needed. By understanding these complexities, we can choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem, balancing the trade-offs between execution time and memory usage. . | It&#39;s not always necessary to use a constant-time algorithm, nor is it always necessary to avoid an exponential-time algorithm. The choice depends on the specific problem, input size, and available resources. For small input sizes, an exponential-time algorithm might be acceptable, as the performance difference may be negligible. Conversely, a constant-time algorithm might not always be optimal, as it may not be the most efficient or practical solution for the problem at hand. . | Some general patterns to determine an algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity include: . | Nested loops: The presence of nested loops often indicates a quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)). For example, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort have nested loops. | . | Divide and conquer: Algorithms that break the problem into smaller subproblems and recursively solve them, such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort, usually have a logarithmic component (O(n*log(n))). | . | Data structure manipulation: The time and space complexity of an algorithm can be influenced by the data structures used. For instance, Heap Sort relies on a binary heap, which results in O(n*log(n)) time complexity. | . | Single-pass algorithms: Algorithms that make a single pass through the data, such as counting sort or radix sort, can have linear time complexity (O(n)), but may come with trade-offs in space complexity or limited applicability to specific types of data. | . | . .

This code is a simple task management program that allows the user to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and list all the tasks. . The program begins by defining an empty dictionary called tasks. The dictionary will store the tasks as keys and a boolean value indicating whether the task has been completed or not. . The program then defines three functions: . add_task: This function adds a task to the dictionary with a value of False (indicating it has not been completed yet). complete_task: This function sets the value of a given task to True (indicating it has been completed). list_tasks: This function iterates through the tasks in the dictionary and prints the task name and its completion status. The program then enters a while loop that prompts the user for an action (either &quot;add&quot;, &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, or &quot;quit&quot;). If the action is &quot;add&quot;, the program prompts the user for a task and adds it to the dictionary using the add_task function. If the action is &quot;complete&quot;, the program prompts the user for a task and marks it as complete using the complete_task function. If the action is &quot;list&quot;, the program lists all the tasks using the list_tasks function. If the action is &quot;quit&quot;, the program breaks out of the while loop and ends. If the user enters an invalid action, the program prints an error message. . Finally, after the while loop ends, the program prints the dictionary of tasks. . Rock Paper Scissors game . import random choices = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] def play_game(): # Get the user&#39;s choice user_choice = input(&quot;Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): &quot;) # Get the computer&#39;s choice computer_choice = random.choice(choices) # Determine the winner if user_choice == computer_choice: result = &quot;Tie&quot; elif user_choice == &quot;rock&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;scissors&quot;: result = &quot;You win!&quot; elif user_choice == &quot;paper&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;rock&quot;: result = &quot;You win!&quot; elif user_choice == &quot;scissors&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;paper&quot;: result = &quot;You win!&quot; else: result = &quot;Computer wins&quot; # Print the results print(f&quot;You chose {user_choice} and the computer chose {computer_choice}&quot;) print(result) # Play the game play_game() . You chose paper and the computer chose rock You win! . This code is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows the user to play against the computer. . The program begins by importing the random module and defining a list of choices. It then defines the play_game function, which prompts the user for their choice and generates a random choice for the computer using the random.choice function. . The program then determines the winner of the game by comparing the user&#39;s choice and the computer&#39;s choice. If the user&#39;s choice is the same as the computer&#39;s choice, it&#39;s a tie. Otherwise, it checks if the user&#39;s choice wins against the computer&#39;s choice using a series of if statements. If none of the conditions are met, the result is &quot;Computer wins&quot;. . The program then prints the results of the game, including the user&#39;s choice and the computer&#39;s choice. . To play the game, you can run this code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it with python filename.py. The program will prompt you to enter your choice, and then print the results of the game. . This is a simple mad libs game . def mad_libs(): noun = input(&quot;Enter a noun: &quot;) verb = input(&quot;Enter a verb: &quot;) adjective = input(&quot;Enter an adjective: &quot;) adverb = input(&quot;Enter an adverb: &quot;) print(f&quot;The {adjective} {noun} likes to {verb} {adverb}.&quot;) mad_libs() . The fast saavan likes to run a lot. . This code is a simple Mad Libs program that prompts the user for a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb, and then uses those words to create and print a sentence. . The program begins by defining the mad_libs function, which prompts the user for a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb and stores them in variables. It then uses these variables to create a sentence using string formatting, and prints the sentence to the screen. . To play Mad Libs, you can run this code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file and run it with python filename.py. The program will prompt you to enter the words, and then print the generated sentence. You can customize the program by adding more prompts for different parts of speech and incorporating them into the sentence. You can also add more sentences or create a function to generate multiple Mad Libs sentences. Let me know if you have any specific questions about how to customize the program! .",

The goal of the code library would be to compile a collection of reusable code snippets and algorithms that students can contribute to and draw from for their projects. | . To initiate this crowdsource project, the instructor could provide a template for code submissions that includes the type of code snippet, a brief description, and any relevant information. The instructor could then announce the project to the class and encourage students to submit their code snippets via a shared online platform such as Google Drive or Github. . To encourage participation, the instructor could offer extra credit or recognition for the students who submit the most valuable code snippets. Additionally, the instructor could lead a class discussion on the different submissions and provide feedback on how the students can improve their code. . Crowdsourcing could potentially enhance your period tracker project at Del Norte High School by providing access to a larger and more diverse user base. By allowing students to contribute to and use the app, you can gather valuable feedback and insights that could improve its functionality and overall user experience. | . For example, students could provide suggestions for new features or report any bugs they encounter. This information could then be used to make updates and improvements to the app. Additionally, crowdsourced data could be used to generate statistics and insights into menstrual patterns, which could provide valuable information for both students and teachers. . I could gain data about the different types of cooding teqhniques each students sued for their various projects and complie that data to show teachers which were mostly used for each subject/topic. | .",

            "content": "Project Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of creating a period tracker . Improved fertility awareness: A period tracker can help a person understand their menstrual cycle and predict when they are most likely to conceive. . | Better symptom management: Keeping track of menstrual symptoms such as cramps, headaches, and mood changes can help individuals plan and prepare for them, and also help them identify patterns or potential issues that may need to be addressed by a healthcare provider. . | Increased control over contraception: A period tracker can help individuals better plan and use contraception, such as by identifying when they are most likely to be fertile and when they can safely have unprotected sex. . | . A potenial harm of creating a period tracker . One potential harmful effect of creating a period tracker is that it may contribute to increased stress and anxiety. For some individuals, constantly monitoring their menstrual cycle and symptoms may cause them to fixate on their reproductive health and potentially feel more self-conscious or worried about their menstrual cycle. Additionally, if the period tracker is not accurate or if the individual is not using it correctly, it can lead to confusion or false assumptions about their menstrual cycle which can cause unnecessary stress. | . Some benefits/cons for internet blockers . Pros: Increased Productivity: By blocking distracting websites and apps, internet blockers can increase productivity. Improved Focus: By reducing the temptation to check social media or engage in other distracting activities, internet blockers can help people stay focused on the task at hand. Parental Controls: Internet blockers can be used to restrict access to inappropriate websites for minors and children. Cybersecurity: Internet blockers can be used to prevent access to malicious websites and protect against online threats. . | Cons: Loss of Freedom: Internet blockers limit access to information and restrict freedom of speech. Reduced Access to Information: By blocking certain websites, internet blockers can reduce access to important information. Decreased Innovation: By limiting access to information, internet blockers can reduce opportunities for innovation. Technical Difficulties: Implementing internet blockers can be difficult and may require significant technical expertise. . | . My thoughts on Digital Divide . One concern I have is access to infromation. The digital divide creates a gap between those who have access to technology and the internet and those who do not, leading to unequal access to information and opportunities. | Another concern is economic inequality. The digital divide exacerbates economic inequality, as those who have access to technology and the internet are more likely to be able to take advantage of job and business opportunities. | One last issue I have is social Isolation. The digital divide can lead to social isolation for those who do not have access to technology and the internet, further exacerbating economic and social inequalities. | .",

The college board&#39;s grade and mine disagree in a few ways. I felt like mine was a little harder. whenever a description or code fragment is requested in an inquiry. I wouldn&#39;t notice anything when I looked at the question. The student may have clarified it elsewhere in their response, though. Additionally, I wasn&#39;t entirely sure where sequencing, selection, and iteration were located. I made an effort to find it, but I was forced to deduce it from the video. | My program will have to be quite intricate and capable of having a significant output input, function, and goal.

It is crucial that on understanding the distinction between purpose and function. The objective of the program is purpose. Function is the means through which it is accomplished. A card game of some form could serve as the function and the purpose could be enjoyment. Additionally, this same project did a poor job of explaining things. | . I think my grade is on par with the marks the College Board gave the example projects. I am well aware of the requirements and what my project needs to succeed. My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I think I understtod most of the topics but some of the things I got confused on were related to the identification of lists and parameters. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between them but overall I feel that I learned a lot of new information. | .",

Submission 1: Student 2 actually received a better grade from me than from College Board, who only awarded them a 1/6. I gave them a 2/6. This small disparity was caused by the Procedural Abstraction row, where I had granted the student an extra point since I thought they had successfully demonstrated a one-program code with at least one parameter, but the College Board had decided not to do so. | Submission 2: Given that we could both agree that this student had complied with every single condition necessary to secure their 6/6 mark, there was no disagreement between my scoring and the College Board&#39;s in this case. Each and every objective was comprehensively explained, with a clear purpose and an explanation of inputs and consequences. | Submission 3: The College Board had awarded this student a 5/6 score and I dont agree with this scoring. I think this student got a perfect score. This minor discrepancy stems from the fact that I had given them the point on the program purpose and function row, and it was mainly because the student couldnt address their main function and purpose. | Submission 4: I gave this student a 4/6 while collegeboard gave them a 3/6. The problems really came from the lack of the complexity within their code and their ignorance of adding certain listws. | . Summary . I think my grade is on par with the marks the College Board gave the example projects. I am well aware of the requirements and what my project needs to succeed. My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I also saw that planning is essential for the development process. Lack of explanations of how something works is one of the key reasons a submission might not have satisfied the requirements in one area. | .",

College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | . Reveal Answer - Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. . . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 .

            "content": "Section 3.14.1 - Libraries (Ethan Tran) . Learning Objective . To be able to select appropriate libraries and/or existing code to use in the creation of new programs. . College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange. How can you simulate this situation using a random number generator. . | Also answer this question: What numbers can be outputted from RANDOM(12,20) and what numbers are excluded? . | .

A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) One form of a value is better suited for representation than another. # What is a Variable? | A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. # Data Types | Variables have data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: | integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) # Data Abstraction | Data abstraction can be created with lists. | Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | You can also simplify code segments to better output function and make the process as a whole earlier. | . What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | Boolean and Binary | So similar yet so different. | Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size # Must Knows | A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | .

Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. . | data types- integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. . | lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. . | dictionaries - A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. . | A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . | A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . | An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . | A slash indicates division: a / b . | MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . | algorithms - finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | sequence - a section of code is run only if a condition is met. (ex: if statements) . | selection - repeating steps or instructions over and over again (ex: loops) . | iteration - outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given . | strings - a sequence of characters . | concatenation - combines two or more strings into one . | . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings . Characters: display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol | ex. a, 8, # | Strings: ordered sequences of characters | Length: the number of symbols output. | Concatenation: String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster | Upper: used to check if the argument contains any uppercase characters returns &quot;True&quot; if all characters in the string are uppercase, Otherwise, It returns &quot;False&quot; | Lower: returns the lowercase string from the given string | Traversing Strings: the process of going through a String one character at a time, often using loops | Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements | If: statement executes a piece of code when one statement is false and the following statement is true | Elif: first if statement isn&#39;t true, but want to check for another condition | Else: executes if &quot;if&quot; isn&#39;t true | Nested Conditionals: when more than one decision must be made before the appropriate action can be taken | . Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point . a binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data unsigned: integers that don&#39;t have a sign associated with them ex. 1, 2 | signed: A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647] -100, 80 | Floating point: a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point ex. 5.5 | Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB Boolean: datatype that does true or false | ASCII: a character encoding scheme in which each character is represented by a 7-bit (originally) or 8-bit binary sequence | .",

RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generotr means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) . Tails . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now lets answer some questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 . random(1,100) == 50 . random(1,10) &lt;= 5 . random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The correct answer is A,C, and D. | Why is not answer B? | . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange. How can you simulate this situation using a random number generator. . | Also answer this question: What numbers can be outputed from RANDOM(12,20) and what numbers are excluded? . | .",

            "content": "College Board Final Test Questions and Insight . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . I got this question wrong because I thought that it would be more appropriate if we used a numerical value for the number of abcences rather than anything else. The correct response to this would to just use a boolean variable because the abcence can just be reported on true or false. | Next time I will make sure to deduce what exactly the problem is asking in terms of the variable function and the continue to match the correct option with what is right. | . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . I got this question wrong because I was unaware of how exactly the initialization of the lists works. I was under the impression that maybe it could have been the first list or the next one as it moved down but that was wrong. | I have to realise that the list initilizes three times and then swaps the contents out which is why D would be the correct answer. | . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . For this question I did not understand what exactly represented the timings being above 120 and 50 otherwise. I did not understand what signified the 30 being the value of the maxPS as well. I mostly just took a wild guess on this one which is why this happened. | Next time I will make sure to study this topic more in depth so I can get a better understanding of what exactly the question is asking and the tables are saying. | . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . This was another question relating to the lists I believe and it was kind of goin in order depending on the initialization and whatnot. I thought that the number corresponsing to the letter would be the right answer but that was not the case in this problem. | The arrows signify the number being moved down so in this case the correct answer would have been 20 and not 30 as that is the number corresponding to letter q. | . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . Again, this was another list problem that kind of led to my downfall within this test. These types of problems were confusing for me and I mostly guessed on them which is why it resulted in me getting them wrong. In this specific case you can see that there is more than just numbers and there is forumlas and whatnot. | I need to better study this whole topic in general and I cannot let it confuse me. | .",

            "content": "Night at the Museum Blog! . During Night at the Museum, the class that I explored was Studio Art. Studio Art displayed a lot of the art pieces that they had been working on throughout the trimester. As I was looking around the classroom there was one piece that caught my eye and it was a picture of a Mily Way bar and a Snickers bar on some cards. . . My Thoughts and Analysis on the Picture . This picture stuck out to me because Night at the Museum was so close to halloween so my eyes just drew to the candy on the wall. I really believe that there is some sort of symbolism behind the drawing as the cards are behing the chocolate. The way I interpret that picture if you are spending money on candy then it should be the two choices resembled here. I really thought whoever drew this drawing did a great job creating this icture and making it appealing. I liked how they creatively put meaning behind the picture as well. I feel like one thing they could imprve on is make the symbolism a little more apparent but I guess the beauty of art is to just let the audience interpret the meaning themselves. Overall I thin NATM was a huge success and us students were able to experience a plethora of talents from a lot of different people. . My Rating of the Picture . I believe that this picture deserves a 8.5/10. The Picture was very well drawn and I loved how it kind of resembled the Halloween theme that surrounded it. . What I Believe They Can Improve On . Not much but I feel that if they had to improve on one thing it would be to make the symbolism behind the card in the backround a little more clear. I know that art is based on interpretation of the photograph but if they made it a little more clear then the audience would also be able to better enjoy the piece. . Second Picture in Photography . . My Thoughts and Analysis on the Picture . This picture when I saw it was incredibly beutiful and not only because it was taken by a highschool student but because it really captivated nature in its lively state. I think that this picture contrasted not only the colors exteremly well but the focus on animal and the faded backround makes it so much more appealing. It really is a beautiful piece that really resembles nature a lot. It is also incredibly cool how they captured a picture of the moose with its kids as well and it adds a lot more to the sentimental value. . My Rating of the Picture . 10/10, It really is a wonderful picture that was taken and it represents a lot of incredible things about photography. . What I believe They Can Improve On . Honestly, I really dont think they can improve on anything. This picture was wonderfully taken. .",

There are roughly about 40 percent of students who either have too much stress or believe that they are useless in school. | 1/3 of students say they are depressed and 60 percent say they have a ton of anxiety. | . Our Thoughts . Me: I believe that it was incredible to see how many depressed students there are right now. 1/3 is an incredibly large portion and that number needs to be brought severly down because the stress of school is not worth losing ones life over. | Derek: He thought it was interesting how people dealed with stress in the video. He too is a highschool student who suffers from stress so it is important for him to know what he can do to prevent this stress. | Dylan: He thought it was interesting how anxious students got over time. He is worried that he too will be overstressed in college and other aspectes of his life and he needs to find ways to deal with it. | Rohan: He found that the video was relatable and he too was interested in the methods to reliving stress. He thinks that stress hinders the ability to truly learn and that in order to be a good student you need to be able to be flexible. | . People I am grateful for . Someone on campus: Mr Yeung is my biggest idol and inspiration. Without him in this school teaching me I would be lost and have no sense of life. He gives me motivation and daily inspiration because without his help, I would never be able to succed. I want to one day grow up and be like Mr.Yeung. | Someone off campus: Im grateful for my mom cause she cooked some good chicken the other night. | .",

            "title": "Partner NBA Quiz and Extra App",
            "content": "Partner NBA Quiz NBA Stats App . Planning and Blogging Findings . Design . Purpose: Derrick and I wanted to create a quiz that tests our audience about different subjects in the NBA. We wanted to create an interactive program that was appealing and fun for viewers who wanted to take the quiz. The quiz tells you if you got the answer right or wrong and makes you go back to the question if you got it wrong and lets you move on if you got it right. | Complexity: The creation of the quiz was not as complex because it was basically made using the same code over and over again. We did not really have to learn whole new langueages in order to incorporate different things into the quiz, everything was pretty straight forward. There were just different buttons and function blocks that we needed to put in certain places in order to output the results we needed to output. | . Successes . Purpose: The code again was pretty simple to incorporate so the final product came out as we had expected it come out. All the functions we incorporated had worked and the quiz ran smoothly. | Data Abstraction: In certain situations we would mix up some of the screen variables and the button would lead you to the wrong place but a small investigation of the code would lead to solving these problems fairly quickly. | Complexity: It was a long and tedious process because you had to repeat this code over and over again just to switch between screens and whatnot. Finding and incorporating the code was quite easy but it was how much of it we needed which was the tedious part. | . Discoveries . I learned how to create different things within the app to make it more interactive. For example, I learned how to create different dropdown menus and how to even lead a button on to a different screen. I learned how different variables can be manipulated in the overall bigger function to get you to some place that you want the viewer to go to. | . Challenges . Our problems were rather small to start off with but they were sometimes very tedious. There were times where we would input a wrong variable in a long chain of code and it would take a minute to find where we had inputed that wrong variable. There were other times that we had not known what line of code we needed to perform a certain function. For example, there was a time where we were not able to figure out how to switch screens using a button because we could not find the line of code required for this task. This took a while to figure out but besides that, all the coding was rather straight forward. | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
