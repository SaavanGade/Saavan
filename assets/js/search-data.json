For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | .

Why I got this Question Wrong? . I got this question wrong because I was unaware of how exactly the initialization of the lists works. I was under the impression that maybe it could have been the first list or the next one as it moved down but that was wrong. | I have to realise that the list initilizes three times and then swaps the contents out which is why D would be the correct answer. | . . Why I got this Question Wrong? . For this question I did not understand what exactly represented the timings being above 120 and 50 otherwise. I did not understand what signified the 30 being the value of the maxPS as well.

I feel like one thing they could imprve on is make the symbolism a little more apparent but I guess the beauty of art is to just let the audience interpret the meaning themselves. Overall I thin NATM was a huge success and us students were able to experience a plethora of talents from a lot of different people. . My Rating of the Picture . I believe that this picture deserves a 8.5/10. The Picture was very well drawn and I loved how it kind of resembled the Halloween theme that surrounded it. . What I Believe They Can Improve On . Not much but I feel that if they had to improve on one thing it would be to make the symbolism behind the card in the backround a little more clear. I know that art is based on interpretation of the photograph but if they made it a little more clear then the audience would also be able to better enjoy the piece. . Second Picture in Photography . . My Thoughts and Analysis on the Picture . This picture when I saw it was incredibly beutiful and not only because it was taken by a highschool student but because it really captivated nature in its lively state. I think that this picture contrasted not only the colors exteremly well but the focus on animal and the faded backround makes it so much more appealing. It really is a beautiful piece that really resembles nature a lot. It is also incredibly cool how they captured a picture of the moose with its kids as well and it adds a lot more to the sentimental value. . My Rating of the Picture . 10/10, It really is a wonderful picture that was taken and it represents a lot of incredible things about photography. . What I believe They Can Improve On . Honestly, I really dont think they can improve on anything. This picture was wonderfully taken. .",

There are roughly about 40 percent of students who either have too much stress or believe that they are useless in school. | 1/3 of students say they are depressed and 60 percent say they have a ton of anxiety. | . Our Thoughts . Me: I believe that it was incredible to see how many depressed students there are right now. 1/3 is an incredibly large portion and that number needs to be brought severly down because the stress of school is not worth losing ones life over. | Derek: He thought it was interesting how people dealed with stress in the video. He too is a highschool student who suffers from stress so it is important for him to know what he can do to prevent this stress. | Dylan: He thought it was interesting how anxious students got over time. He is worried that he too will be overstressed in college and other aspectes of his life and he needs to find ways to deal with it. | Rohan: He found that the video was relatable and he too was interested in the methods to reliving stress. He thinks that stress hinders the ability to truly learn and that in order to be a good student you need to be able to be flexible. | . People I am grateful for . Someone on campus: Mr Yeung is my biggest idol and inspiration. Without him in this school teaching me I would be lost and have no sense of life. He gives me motivation and daily inspiration because without his help, I would never be able to succed. I want to one day grow up and be like Mr.Yeung. | Someone off campus: Im grateful for my mom cause she cooked some good chicken the other night. | .",

            "title": "Partner NBA Quiz and Extra App",
            "content": "Partner NBA Quiz NBA Stats App . Planning and Blogging Findings . Design . Purpose: Derrick and I wanted to create a quiz that tests our audience about different subjects in the NBA. We wanted to create an interactive program that was appealing and fun for viewers who wanted to take the quiz. The quiz tells you if you got the answer right or wrong and makes you go back to the question if you got it wrong and lets you move on if you got it right. | Complexity: The creation of the quiz was not as complex because it was basically made using the same code over and over again. We did not really have to learn whole new langueages in order to incorporate different things into the quiz, everything was pretty straight forward. There were just different buttons and function blocks that we needed to put in certain places in order to output the results we needed to output. | . Successes . Purpose: The code again was pretty simple to incorporate so the final product came out as we had expected it come out. All the functions we incorporated had worked and the quiz ran smoothly. | Data Abstraction: In certain situations we would mix up some of the screen variables and the button would lead you to the wrong place but a small investigation of the code would lead to solving these problems fairly quickly. | Complexity: It was a long and tedious process because you had to repeat this code over and over again just to switch between screens and whatnot. Finding and incorporating the code was quite easy but it was how much of it we needed which was the tedious part. | . Discoveries . I learned how to create different things within the app to make it more interactive. For example, I learned how to create different dropdown menus and how to even lead a button on to a different screen. I learned how different variables can be manipulated in the overall bigger function to get you to some place that you want the viewer to go to. | . Challenges . Our problems were rather small to start off with but they were sometimes very tedious. There were times where we would input a wrong variable in a long chain of code and it would take a minute to find where we had inputed that wrong variable. There were other times that we had not known what line of code we needed to perform a certain function. For example, there was a time where we were not able to figure out how to switch screens using a button because we could not find the line of code required for this task. This took a while to figure out but besides that, all the coding was rather straight forward. | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
