<ul>
<li>Submission 1: Student 2 actually received a better grade from me than from College Board, who only awarded them a 1/6. I gave them a 2/6. This small disparity was caused by the Procedural Abstraction row, where I had granted the student an extra point since I thought they had successfully demonstrated a one-program code with at least one parameter, but the College Board had decided not to do so.</li>
<li>Submission 2: Given that we could both agree that this student had complied with every single condition necessary to secure their 6/6 mark, there was no disagreement between my scoring and the College Board's in this case. Each and every objective was comprehensively explained, with a clear purpose and an explanation of inputs and consequences.</li>
<li>Submission 3: The College Board had awarded this student a 5/6 score and I dont agree with this scoring. I think this student got a perfect score. This minor discrepancy stems from the fact that I had given them the point on the program purpose and function row, and it was mainly because the student couldnt address their main function and purpose. </li>
<li>Submission 4: I gave this student a 4/6 while collegeboard gave them a 3/6. The problems really came from the lack of the complexity within their code and their ignorance of adding certain listws. </li>

<ul>
<li>I think my grade is on par with the marks the College Board gave the example projects. I am well aware of the requirements and what my project needs to succeed. My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I also saw that planning is essential for the development process. Lack of explanations of how something works is one of the key reasons a submission might not have satisfied the requirements in one area. </li>
