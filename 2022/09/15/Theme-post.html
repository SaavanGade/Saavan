<h1 id="theme-post">Theme Post</h1>
<ul>
  <li>In this theme I was not able to see any of the tabs such as about me or the tags or even the search.</li>
  <li>This was a problem because navigating around the blog becomes more difficult and it results in a worse user interface rather than a better one.</li>
  <li>The looks of the theme is not worth the problems that are now assosiated with it.</li>
</ul>
