<ul>
  <li>Derrick and I will collaborate and create a theme/idea we are thinking of doing.</li>
  <li>As of now one Idea I have that we can do is to create a page where you can click on different basketball players and get links to their greatest highlights and statistics. We can add a search engine so people can search up their names and then find the desired player thehy are looking for. It would allow anyone to easily be able to search for a player and get their best highlights and statistics.</li>
  <li>We will likely create different ways to split work such as coding on a notebook and then sharing the code or doing different parts of the coding on different things.</li>
  <li>By splitting the work and resolving on an idea we will be able to find a solution to actually create this project and finalize a code. We will then submit a working project by video.</li>
</ul>
