<p># Daily Video 1</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a development process to develop a program</li>
  <li>Design a program and its user interface</li>
  <li>A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature</li>
  <li>Common phases when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing</li>
  <li>Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases</li>
  <li>Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer</li>
  <li>Investigate by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="daily-video-2">Daily Video 2</h1>
<ul>
  <li>When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively</li>
  <li>When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation</li>
  <li>Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components</li>
  <li>Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation</li>
  <li>Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code</li>
  <li>Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them
    <h1 id="daily-video-3">Daily Video 3</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation</li>
  <li>Program documentation: a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed EX: comments (don’t effect how the program runs)</li>
  <li>Should actively document throughout development to help development as well as maintaining correct programs</li>
  <li>Program documentation created to: describe the program, list specifications, describe different parts of the program, list of contributors</li>
  <li>Document process: beginning: list specifications, during: keep track of progress, after: explain overall process</li>
  <li>Documentation improves: programming process efficiency, ability to test and refine program.</li>
</ul>
