    "# Performance Task Idea \n",
    "- Derrick and I will collaborate and create a theme/idea we are thinking of doing. \n",
    "- As of now one Idea I have that we can do is to create a page where you can click on different basketball players and get links to their greatest highlights and statistics. We can add a search engine so people can search up their names and then find the desired player thehy are looking for. It would allow for anyone to easily be able to search for a player and get their best highslights and statistics. \n",
    "- We will likely create different ways to split work such as coding on a notebook and then sharing the code or doing different parts of the coding on different things. \n",
    "- By splitting the work and resolving on an idea we will be able to find a solution to actually create this project and finalize a code. "
