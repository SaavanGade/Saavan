    "- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).\n",
    "- Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code\n",
    "- Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) One form of a value is better suited for representation than another.\n",
    "# What is a Variable?\n",
    "- A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run.\n",
    "# Data Types\n",
    "- Variables have data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below:\n",
    "- integer (numbers)\n",
    "- string (or text/letters)\n",
    "- Boolean (True/False statements) \n",
    "# Data Abstraction \n",
    "- Data abstraction can be created with lists.\n",
    "- Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths.\n",
    "- The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. \n",
    "- You can also simplify code segments to better output function and make the process as a whole earlier. \n"
