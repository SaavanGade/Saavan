- A lot of these alumni are majoring in engineering, CS, and cogsci (mainly going into UC)
- Some people did compsci at a really young age... some started from 2nd grade
- Other majors could have CS in it
- Profound interest in compsci
- could be a struggle early on with github and other things...
- **Google is your friend!**
- Focus on your own path and your own curve... it does not matter where other people are
- Some hard transition to college based on content taught
- Motivation could be easily lost and a lot of people will cut corners... have the "above and beyond" mindset.
