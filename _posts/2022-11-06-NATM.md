# Night at the Museum Blog! 
During Night at the Museum, the class that I explored was Studio Art. Studio Art displayed a lot of the art pieces that they had been working on throughout the trimester. As I was looking around the classroom there was one piece that caught my eye and it was a picture of a Mily Way bar and a Snickers bar on some cards.

## My Thoughts and Analysis on the Picture ##
This picture stuck out to me because Night at the Museum was so close to halloween so my eyes just drew to the candy on the wall. I really believe that there is some sort of symbolism behind the drawing as the cards are behing the chocolate. The way I interpret that picture if you are spending money on candy then it should be the two choices resembled here. I really thought whoever drew this drawing did a great job creating this icture and making it appealing. I liked how they creatively put meaning behind the picture as well. I feel like one thing they could imprve on is make the symbolism a little more apparent but I guess the beauty of art is to just let the audience interpret the meaning themselves. Overall I thin NATM was a huge success and us students were able to experience a plethora of talents from a lot of different people. 
## My Rating of the Picture ##
I believe that this picture deserves a 8.5/10. The Picture was very well drawn and I loved how it kind of resembled the Halloween theme that surrounded it. 
## What I Believe They Can Improve On ## 
Not much but I feel that if they had to improve on one thing it would be to make the symbolism behind the card in the backround a little more clear. I know that art is based on interpretation of the photograph but if they made it a little more clear then the audience would also be able to better enjoy the piece.
