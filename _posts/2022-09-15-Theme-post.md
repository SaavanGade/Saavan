# Theme Post 
- In this theme I was not able to see any of the tabs such as about me or the tags or even the search. 
- This was a problem because navigating around the blog becomes more difficult and it results in a worse user interface rather than a better one.
- The looks of the theme is not worth the problems that are now assosiated with it.
