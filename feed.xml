This was a problem because navigating around the blog becomes more difficult and it results in a worse user interface rather than a better one. The looks of the theme is not worth the problems that are now assosiated with it.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mi</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/MI.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mi" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/MI</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[HONORS MEDICAL INTERVENTION AS OF 8/28/2022]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Performance Task Planning</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Performance-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Performance Task Planning" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Performance-post</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance Task Idea Derrick and I will collaborate and create a theme/idea we are thinking of doing. As of now one Idea I have that we can do is to create a page where you can click on different basketball players and get links to their greatest highlights and statistics. We can add a search engine so people can search up their names and then find the desired player thehy are looking for. It would allow anyone to easily be able to search for a player and get their best highlights and statistics. We will likely create different ways to split work such as coding on a notebook and then sharing the code or doing different parts of the coding on different things. By splitting the work and resolving on an idea we will be able to find a solution to actually create this project and finalize a code. We will then submit a working project by video.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stats</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Stats.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stats" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Stats</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[AP STATISTICS AS OF 8/28/2022]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Government</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Government.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Government" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/09/11/Government</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[AP GOVERNMENT AS OF 8/28/2022]]></summary></entry></feed>
