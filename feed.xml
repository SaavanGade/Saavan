During Night at the Museum, the class that I explored was Studio Art. Studio Art displayed a lot of the art pieces that they had been working on throughout the trimester. As I was looking around the classroom there was one piece that caught my eye and it was a picture of a Mily Way bar and a Snickers bar on some cards. This picture stuck out to me because Night at the Museum was so close to halloween so my eyes just drew to the candy on the wall. I really believe that there is some sort of symbolism behind the drawing as the cards are behing the chocolate. The way I interpret that picture if you are spending money on candy then it should be the two choices resembled here. I really thought whoever drew this drawing did a great job creating this icture and making it appealing. I liked how they creatively put meaning behind the picture as well. I feel like one thing they could imprve on is make the symbolism a little more apparent but I guess the beauty of art is to just let the audience interpret the meaning themselves. Overall I thin NATM was a huge success and us students were able to experience a plethora of talents from a lot of different people.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mi</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/11/06/MI.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mi" /><published>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/11/06/MI</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[HONORS MEDICAL INTERVENTION AS OF 8/28/2022]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Government</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/11/06/Government.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Government" /><published>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/2022/11/06/Government</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[AP GOVERNMENT AS OF 8/28/2022]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Idea 1 ‘Identifying and Correcting Errors’</title><link href="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/collegeboard/error" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Idea 1 ‘Identifying and Correcting Errors’" /><published>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/collegeboard/AP-error_testing</id><author><name></name></author><category term="1.B" /><category term="4.C" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Practice with identifying and correcting code blocks]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/images/apcsp.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://saavangade.github.io/Saavan/images/apcsp.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
